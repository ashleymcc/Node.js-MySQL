# Node.js-MySQL
Introduction
I created an Amazon-like storefront app, called Bamazon, using MySQL, Node and Inquire.
Using CLI this app takes in orders from customer and depletes from the store's stock, (MySQL)
The app first displays a list of all of the available products, their costs, and current stock.

Npm packages 
-mysql
-inquire
